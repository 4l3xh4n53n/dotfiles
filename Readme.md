<hr>

This is my rice, it should adapt the colour scheme to any background automatically as long as you change the file names of the background or add a keybind which switches the background and then you run all of the correct sh files.

It also has rofi but I didn't know how to take a screenshot of it without too much hastle.

Hope you like it (:
